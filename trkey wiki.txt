4. Configuration & Export
Exporting Your Trkey Keymap
Once you've defined your macros, combos, and shortcuts, the Trkey Keymap Configurator provides a ready-to-use configuration that you can integrate with your Trkey keyboard firmware.
Understanding the "Current Keymap JSON Preview"
Navigate to the SETTINGS tab. The large text area labeled "Current Keymap JSON Preview" displays the raw configuration data generated by your current selections. This output is dynamically updated in real-time as you add, edit, or delete items.
   * Format: The output is in a JSON format, designed to be easily parsable by your Trkey keyboard's firmware (e.g., QMK).
   * Sections: You'll generally see sections for:
   * layers: Your defined keymap layers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3), with each key represented by its macro reference.
   * macros: Your defined macros with their names (e.g., MACRO_HELLO_WORLD) and sequences.
   * combos: An empty array for now, as combo functionality is not yet fully integrated into the export.
How to Export Your Keymap
   1. Review the Output: Carefully examine the "Current Keymap JSON Preview" to ensure it matches your desired configuration.
   2. Export as JSON File:
   * Click the "Export Keymap JSON" button.
   * This will download a trkey_config.json file to your computer containing the entire configuration.
   3. Integrate with Your Trkey Keyboard:

6. Technical Details
Technical Overview
This page provides a high-level overview of the Trkey Keymap Configurator's technical structure for those interested in its inner workings or contributing to its development.
Project Structure
The Trkey Keymap Configurator is a single-page web application built primarily with:
      * HTML (index.html): The main structure of the web page, including all React components, CSS, and JavaScript embedded directly for single-file deployment.
      * CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, loaded via CDN. Custom scrollbar styles are also embedded.
      * JavaScript (React): The core logic for the application, handling user interaction, state management, and output generation. JSX syntax is used, which is transpiled in the browser by Babel Standalone.
Key Components (JavaScript/React)
The application is structured around several React functional components:
      * App: The root component that manages the overall application state, including:
      * keymap: An object representing the 3x3 grid for each layer.
      * activeLayer: The currently selected layer for editing.
      * shortcutPool: An object containing all available shortcuts, categorized (including dynamically added "MACRO" and "AI GENERATED" categories).
      * macros: An array of user-defined macro objects.
      * showModal, showMacroFormModal, showConfirmationModal, showAddShortcutModal: States for controlling modal visibility.
      * selectedKeyForMapping: Stores the coordinates of a keymap cell selected for click-to-map.
      * connectedPort: Stores the Web Serial API port object if a device is connected.
      * aiPrompt, aiMacroPrompt: User input for AI generation.
      * isGeneratingAiShortcuts, isGeneratingAiMacros: Loading states for AI features.
      * KeyComponent: A reusable component representing a single key on the micropad grid or a shortcut in the pool. It displays the combo and description, and handles drag-and-drop events.
      * Modal Components:
      * Modal: A generic modal component for displaying information or error messages.
      * MacroFormModal: Specific modal for adding or editing macro details.
      * ConfirmationModal: Used for user confirmations (e.g., before deleting a macro).
      * AddShortcutModal: For adding new custom shortcuts to the pool.
How Output is Generated
      1. State Management: User interactions (e.g., assigning a shortcut, defining a macro) update the application's internal React state (e.g., the keymap object, the macros array).
      2. useEffect Hooks: React's useEffect hooks are used to perform side effects, such as:
      * Loading/saving profiles to localStorage.
      * Updating the "MACRO" category in shortcutPool when macros change.
      * Attaching/detaching keyboard event listeners for the "KEY TESTER."
      3. JSON Transformation: When the relevant state changes, the exportKeymap function (or similar logic for the preview) transforms the internal JavaScript objects into the required JSON format for the Trkey keyboard firmware.
      * Macro names are sanitized (uppercased, spaces replaced with underscores, special characters removed) to conform to typical firmware naming conventions.
      * The 3x3 keymap grid is flattened into a 9-element array for each layer.
      4. JSON.stringify(): The transformed JavaScript object is then converted into a readable JSON string using JSON.stringify(..., null, 2) for pretty-printing.
      5. Display & Download: The resulting JSON string is displayed in the "Current Keymap JSON Preview" <pre> tag. When "Export Keymap JSON" is clicked, this string is used to create a Blob and trigger a file download.
Web Serial API Integration
      * The connectToDevice, disconnectDevice, and uploadKeymapToConnectedDevice functions handle interaction with physical devices.
      * They use navigator.serial.requestPort(), port.open(), port.writable.getWriter(), and writer.write() to communicate with the serial port.
      * Data is sent as a UTF-8 encoded JSON string.
Local Development (for Contributors)
To run and modify this application locally:
      1. Save the File: Save the entire HTML content as index.html.
      2. Open in Browser: Open index.html directly in a modern web browser (preferably Chrome or Edge for Web Serial API support).
      3. Edit Code: You can directly edit the JavaScript code within the <script type="text/babel"> tags and refresh your browser to see changes.
Note: Since this is a single-file setup using Babel Standalone, there's no traditional npm install or npm start command. All dependencies (React, ReactDOM, Babel) are loaded via CDNs.
